What is a precompiled header? Name pros and cons:
A precompiled header is a special type of header file in C/C++ that is compiled and stored in memory before any other source code in a program is compiled. This is done to speed up compilation time by avoiding the need to recompile the header files each time a source file is compiled.

Pros:
- Improved compilation speed
- Reuse of code across multiple source files
- Reduced compilation time

Cons:
- More memory usage
- Harder to debug
- Increase in size of executables

Describe the layer of abstraction with your own words:
Layer of abstraction is a concept that provides an interface between two different systems or components in order to hide the complexity of one system from the other. 
The interface provides a simplified view of the lower-level system, allowing the higher-level system to interact with the lower-level system without needing to know its internal details. 
This can make it easier to develop programs and also to maintain them.


Name the SOLID principles and describe them briefly
SOLID is an acronym for five object-oriented design principles:
Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
Open/Closed Principle: A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle: Subclasses should be able to be used in place of their superclasses without the client noticing any difference.
Interface Segregation Principle: Multiple, smaller, specific interfaces are better than one large, general-purpose interface.
Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
