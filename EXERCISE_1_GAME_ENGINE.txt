What is the difference between git and github?

Git is a version control system, a tool to manage your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. It provides other features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

Name 3 benefits of a version control system:

1. Improved collaboration: Version control systems help teams collaborate more efficiently by allowing them to share and work on code concurrently. 

2. Easier debugging: Version control systems provide visibility into the history of changes, which makes it easier to debug and identify errors.

3. Increased security: Version control systems provide a secure backup of all your code, which can be used to quickly restore any changes that might have gone wrong.

Name 3 alternatives to git:

1. Mercurial
2. Apache Subversion (SVN)
3. BitKeeper

Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:

1. Git allows users to work offline and commit changes when they are back online, while other version control systems require users to always be connected.

2. Git is distributed, meaning each user has a complete copy of the repository, while other version control systems are centralized and require a single server to host the repository.

Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:

1. Merging large files can be difficult with version control systems, as the files often contain binary data that is not easily merged.

2. Unreal Engine projects can become corrupted if the user does not properly manage their file structure.

3. Unity projects can be difficult to manage with version control systems due to the large number of dependencies.

4. Unreal Engine can be slow to compile, leading to long wait times for builds.

5. The individual files for a Unity project can be difficult to track and manage in version control systems.

6. Unreal Engine can suffer from long loading times when loading large levels.

7. Unity projects often require manual intervention to properly synchronize with version control systems.

8. Unreal Engine can be difficult to debug in certain situations, as the engine often has a complex internal structure.
